# Employee-and-Manager-Inheritance-Project

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates *inheritance* and *method overriding* using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.  
The program uses two classes: Employee and Manager, where the Manager class inherits properties from the Employee class.

---

## Program Overview

- An Employee object is created with:
  - Name  
  - ID  
  - Salary  

- A Manager object is created with:
  - Name  
  - ID  
  - Salary  
  - Additional *department* value  

---

## Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- *Inheritance*  
  The Manager class inherits common properties and methods from the Employee class.

- *Method Overriding*  
  The display() method is overridden in the Manager class to include department details.

- *Polymorphism*  
  The correct version of the display() method is executed based on the object type.

## Program Execution Steps

1. Create an Employee object with basic details.
2. Create a Manager object with additional department information.
3. Call the display() method for both objects.
4. Output shows role-specific details due to method overriding.
