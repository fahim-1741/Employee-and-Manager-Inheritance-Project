# Employee-and-Manager-Inheritance-Project

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates inheritance and method overriding using object-oriented programming concepts.
The program uses two classes, employee and manager, where the manager class inherits properties from the employee class.

An employee object is created with name, ID, and salary.

A manager object is created with an additional department value.

The display() method is called for both objects.

Method overriding ensures the correct details are shown.
